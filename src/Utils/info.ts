    description: "The wave equation is a 2nd-order partial differential equation used to describe wave phenomena such as mechanical and electromagnetic waves. This article explores solving the wave equation using the finite-difference method in 1D and 2D, covering discretization, damping, and various boundary conditions for different behaviors.",
